# w make Ubuntu

This [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) variant was created using [Cubic](https://github.com/PJ-Singh-001/Cubic) and the custom bash script
applications that can distract from learning (games, media players, etc.) have been removed. The installer and other hard drive manipulation applications (eg GParted) were also removed.
This is not a new distribution, I did not try to create a new look. A ready-to-use solution to replace non-working systems or for home learning without installation

The Live system can be used in Hungarian.

Added apps:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Visual Studio Code
- PxCharm
- Wireshark

Minimum system requirements 2 GB RAM (optimal 4 GB RAM).
